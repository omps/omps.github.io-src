=======================
Planning the year ahead
=======================

    This is how I am planning to spend 2016. I have most of the time procarstinated a lot, and I am very much fed of it. I was going through an article yesterday on lifehacker `What It Takes to Form a Good Habit<http://lifehacker.com/what-it-takes-to-form-a-good-habit-5724234>`_, which was about how can we form habits and achieve big goals by starting small, and forming small habits for the things which we want to do and ultimately doing it in the long run.

    Though this list is going to be the bigger picture, but surely I can try to maintain a monthly review of what I have achieved every month and how well I am following on my tasks as the year's passing ahead.
